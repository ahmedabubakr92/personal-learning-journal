            <h1 class="blog-post-title">From Figma to Code: Building Oldagram</h1>
            <p class="blog-post-intro">
                I just shipped my latest solo project: <strong>"Oldagram"</strong>—an Instagram feed clone built entirely from a Figma design file with no starter code. The challenge? I was given a Figma design file and a blank text editor. This was a complete journey through the frontend workflow.
            </p>
            <img src="images/oldagram/oldagram_2.jpeg" alt="Oldagram Instagram clone interface showing the feed" class="blog-post-image">
            
            <h2 class="blog-section-title">The Build: Deconstructing Figma</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I started by deconstructing the Figma design, building the mobile-first layout from scratch using <strong>Semantic HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS Flexbox</strong>. This process taught me how to translate visual design into code structure—identifying spacing, typography, colors, and layout patterns from the design file.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The mobile-first approach was crucial. By starting with the smallest screen size and building up, I ensured the layout would work perfectly on mobile devices before adapting to larger screens. This workflow taught me the importance of progressive enhancement and responsive design principles.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-section-title">The Logic: Refactoring to Reusable Templates</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Once the UI was pixel-perfect, I didn't stop there. I refactored the hard-coded sections into a <strong>reusable JavaScript template</strong>. Instead of manually writing HTML for each post, I created a function that could generate post HTML from data objects.
            </p>
            <img src="images/oldagram/oldagram_1.gif" alt="Oldagram double-tap-to-like feature in action" class="blog-post-image">
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                This refactoring process was a major learning moment. It showed me the power of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and how templates can make code more maintainable. If I needed to change the post structure, I only had to update it in one place, not throughout the entire HTML.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-section-title">The Interaction: Custom State Management</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I implemented a custom state management system where the feed is rendered dynamically from data. This means the entire feed can be controlled by a single data array, and changes to that array automatically update the UI. This pattern is fundamental to modern web development and gave me deep insight into how state-driven applications work.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                The state management system forced me to think carefully about data flow. When a user interacts with the app—liking a post, for example—I needed to update the state and then re-render only what changed. This taught me about the relationship between data and UI, a concept that translates directly to frameworks like React.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-section-title">Double-Tap-to-Like: Surgical DOM Updates</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                One of the coolest features I implemented was a <strong>"double-tap-to-like"</strong> feature that updates the DOM surgically without re-rendering the whole page. When a user double-taps on a post image, the like count increments and the heart icon fills, but only that specific post's elements are updated.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                This feature taught me about efficient DOM manipulation. Instead of re-rendering the entire feed, I learned to target specific elements and update them directly. This approach is not only more performant but also provides a smoother user experience with no flickering or layout shifts.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-section-title">The Complete Frontend Workflow</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                This project took me through the complete frontend workflow:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li><strong>Design Analysis:</strong> Breaking down the Figma file into components and patterns</li>
                <li><strong>HTML Structure:</strong> Creating semantic, accessible markup</li>
                <li><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> Mobile-first responsive design with Flexbox</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript Logic:</strong> Transforming static HTML into dynamic templates</li>
                <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Building a data-driven application</li>
                <li><strong>User Interactions:</strong> Implementing smooth, efficient DOM updates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="blog-section-title">What I Learned</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                It's an amazing feeling to watch a static image file turn into a living, clickable application. This project reinforced several key concepts:
            </p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>The importance of starting with mobile-first design</li>
                <li>How to translate design files into code structure</li>
                <li>The power of reusable templates and DRY principles</li>
                <li>State management in vanilla JavaScript</li>
                <li>Efficient DOM manipulation techniques</li>
                <li>The complete frontend development workflow</li>
