🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **My Learning Journal** — A fully responsive, mobile-first blog built from scratch!

📖 **The Journey:**
After transitioning from data science to full-stack development, I've been documenting my learning journey through Scrimba's Full-Stack Developer Career Path. This project challenged me to build a production-ready blog using only HTML & CSS—no frameworks, just pure web fundamentals.

✨ **What I Built:**
✅ Mobile-first responsive design (breaks beautifully at every screen size)
✅ Semantic HTML & modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables)
✅ Hamburger menu navigation
✅ Multiple pages: Home, About, and detailed blog posts
✅ Fully personalized with my actual projects and learning experiences

🎯 **Key Features:**
- 📱 Designed mobile-first, then scaled up
- 🎨 Pixel-perfect implementation from Figma design
- ✨ Smooth animations and interactions
- 🧱 Clean, semantic code structure

📝 **The Blog Showcases:**
- My restaurant ordering app (Jimmy's Diner)
- Instagram clone (Oldagram) built from Figma
- Password generator tool
- Data science projects (YellowPages scraper, Real estate analysis)
- And my journey transitioning from Python/SQL to full-stack development

💡 **What I Learned:**
This project reinforced the importance of building from scratch. Every line of code was intentional, every media query carefully crafted. The mobile-first approach isn't just a buzzword—it's a fundamental mindset shift that changes how you think about design and development.
