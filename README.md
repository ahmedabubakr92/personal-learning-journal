# 📘 My Learning Journal — Responsive Blog (Scrimba Project)

A **mobile-first, fully responsive learning journal blog** built from scratch using **modern HTML & CSS best practices**.  
This project is part of my learning journey through **Scrimba**, where I'm turning concepts into real layouts and improving step-by-step.

**Live Demo:** [Will add later]

## 🎯 The Mission
The goal of this project was to move beyond tutorials and build a production-ready layout using **Vanilla HTML & CSS**. I built this "mobile-first," meaning the design starts on small screens and adapts to desktops using media queries—ensuring a perfect experience on any device.

## ✅ Requirements Met
- ✅ Built each page from scratch
- ✅ Made all pages responsive:
  - ✅ Relative units (`rem`, `%`, `vw`)
  - ✅ Mobile-first design
  - ✅ Media queries for tablet and desktop
  - ✅ Viewport meta tags

## 🚀 Stretch Goals Completed
- ✅ Made it my own (personalized content)
- ✅ Added custom images (using project assets)
- ✅ Wrote about my learning experience
- ✅ Added new pages (Home, About, Blog Post)
- ✅ Responsive navigation with hamburger menu on smaller screens

## 🚀 Key Features
- **📱 Mobile-First Workflow:** Designed for small screens first, then scaled up.
- **📐 Responsive Design:** Uses relative units (`rem`, `%`, `vw`) and CSS Grid/Flexbox.
- **🎨 Modern Styling:** Built with CSS Variables for consistent theming.
- **🧱 Semantic HTML:** Accessible, clean code structure (no `div` soup!).
- **✨ Custom Content:** Featuring real stories from my learning experience transitioning from data science to full-stack development.
- **🍔 Hamburger Menu:** Mobile-friendly navigation with smooth animations.
- **📄 Three Complete Pages:** Home, About Me, and Blog Post detail pages.

## 🧱 Pages
- **Home (`index.html`):** Hero post with featured article and recent posts grid
- **About (`about.html`):** Personal introduction and learning journey story
- **Blog Post (`post.html`):** Individual blog post detail page with full content

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (Semantic layout)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries, CSS Variables)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (Hamburger menu functionality)
- **Git/GitHub** (Version Control)
- **Figma** (Design to Code implementation)
